# office-boy

Office Boy is a web application that helps manage daily tasks for employees by assigning them to the designated office personnel. To ensure its effectiveness, I've created a set of detailed test cases on TestRail. These test cases cover various scenarios to check how the application responds, how accurately it allocates tasks, and if its user interface is consistent.

During testing, I came across several bugs. These issues ranged from small visual problems to more significant glitches that affected how the app functions. I made sure to document all these bugs on TestRail along with screenshots, so the development team can clearly see what the problems are.

By having these well-documented test cases and bug reports, we're making sure that Office Boy runs smoothly and reliably. This ensures that both employees and office personnel can work efficiently without disruptions caused by technical issues
